LMMs are an extension of simple linear models to allow both fixed and random effects, and are particularly used when there is non-independence in the data, such as arises from a hierarchical structure. They are often preferred over traditional analysis of variance regression models because they can deal with messy data and allow the use of all data, even when there are low sample sizes, structured data, and many covariates to fit. LMMs are applied in many disciplines where multiple correlated measurements are made on each subject, and they are prominently used in research involving human and animal subjects in fields ranging from psychology to baseball analytics and industrial statistics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Packages\n\nFirst we have to install require packages if it not previously installed.

It is important never to report the results of a nonconverging model, as the convergence warnings are an indication that the model has not been reliably estimated and therefore cannot be trusted.\n\nThe first step you should take to address convergence issues is to consider our data set and how your model relates to it, and to ensure that our model has not been misspecified (e.g., have we included by-item random slopes for a predictor that does not actually vary within items?). It is also possible that the convergence warnings stem from imbalanced data:. Sometimes we may use some control parameters, depending on the source of the convergence issues, some may be more appropriate or useful than others.","metadata":{"id":"Rjx44LR90Zth"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model4 <- lmer(Emotion ~ 1 + Sex +  Imagination + (1 + Sex +  Imagination | Faculty) ,control = lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"), data = data)\nsummary(model4)","metadata":{"id":"Yi0aoM-g1exG","outputId":"5a1504b2-9e47-4309-d579-5d9dcebfab24","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.051709Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.05288Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.406136Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot(model4)","metadata":{"id":"eRpafOmXOxhD","outputId":"78ab9dbe-3fc3-41d5-a9ad-a2a7f6ee9953","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.409729Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.411104Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.613359Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this linear mixed-effects model:\n\nRandom effects for Faculty include random intercepts, slopes for Sex2, and slopes for Imagination.\nFixed effects indicate that, on average, participants with Sex2 have a slightly higher Emotion score (estimate = 0.095, p = 0.026), and each one-unit increase in Imagination is associated with an increase of approximately 0.48 units in the predicted Emotion score (p < 0.001).\nThe correlations among fixed effects show negligible correlation between the intercept and Sex2 but a strong negative correlation between the intercept and Imagination, indicating that faculties with higher baseline Emotion scores tend to have a smaller positive effect of Imagination.\n","metadata":{"id":"vAZDVvGzabp0"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Comparison between model4 and modle3","metadata":{"id":"_oBBK4O9VORI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# compare model 4 and model 3\n\nanova(model4,model3, refit = FALSE)\n","metadata":{"id":"MU8FKpJeakt5","outputId":"eb2d51a0-1378-49d5-833b-e25aa5904d0d","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.61561Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.616708Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-19T15:49:14.637773Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The comparison of model fit between the random-intercept model (model3) and the random-slope model (model4) is assessed through an ANOVA.\nUsing an ANOVA reveals that the inclusion of additional predictors in Model 4 does not significantly enhance the fit to the data (Chi-sq = 0.494, df = 4, p = 0.974).
